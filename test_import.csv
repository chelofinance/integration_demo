Today, I'm applying again because I want to join the Talent community.

Last year when I got into web3, I was ramping down a failed B2B SaaS startup that I had been building for the past 2 years. I hadn't planned on getting into anything new but stumbled across web3 and found myself down a rabbithole. A few months later, I decided to start my own NFT project to help fund scholarships for women in STEM since I am very passionate about empowering young women in STEM fields. I learned a lot through this experience and it's actually how I landed my first role in web3 as a product marketing manager at Paper. The community and potential of web3 is what keeps me in the space and being able to meet more individuals in the space on a global scale is something I am really looking forward to.

This opportunity to build something of value to the ecosystem converges with my deep curiosity about web3 technologies, my involvement in the space as a creative, and my drive to own high-impact projects. The idea of using my skills to collaboratively work on a mission to bring about a technological paradigm shift excites me massively. 

I have been involved in the community since early 2021, when I decided to shift the focus of an interview series and community building project that I founded, into Web3. My project, Blank Was A Canvas, is a non-profit community of underrepresented (mostly female & gender non-binary) creatives, offering content to inspire and create representation as well as to share opportunities, such as funding for our community members. I aimed to start sharing stories of creatives who had already made the jump, in order to onboard more artists into the web3 ecosystem. 

1 year later, I have attended over a dozen web3 meetups, become an ambassador for NBX, and a fervent supporter of impact driven projects such as SURGE, F3Ventures, and H.E.R. Dao in Berlin. I have voluntarily created content for Crypto Babes Club, DefyTrends and F3Ventures, and am ready to use my skills to make greater impact in the space. At my current role as Producer and Reporter for 3Beats, I capture riveting stories of some of the humans that are building web3, through interviews. With a proven track record of success in project management and marketing and a fervent interest in creating brand stories, I am super excited to contribute and build at EthRio and EthIstanbul. 

I am ready for my next ambitious challenge, but would greatly benefit from a scholarship, mentors and other support, as a new builder and someone with limited funds.

This experience would be incredibly valuable for my professional development, allowing me to gain practical experience and build my portfolio.
I am confident that I would be a great fit for the program as I have a strong background in design and a keen interest in Web3 technology. Throughout my bachelor's degree, I have worked on various projects that have required me to think outside the box and use my creativity to solve complex problems. I am also currently exploring opportunities for internships in the field and believe that attending Ethereum Rio23 would help me make valuable connections and gain insights that would be invaluable in my job search. Additionally, I attended EthDenver in 2022, which further strengthened my interest and passion for the industry.
In short, I believe that I would be a great addition to the  amazing web3 builders who will attend Ethereum Rio23 in March. I am enthusiastic, hardworking, and always eager to learn new things. I am excited about the prospect of attending this conference and contributing to the community in any way that I can.

As someone who participated and then later volunteered at web2 hackathons, I really believe in the value of the hackathon community ecosystem. I was able to give back after working full time in data science by volunteering as a mentor at hackathons. Now that I am starting my web3 journey, I’m at the beginning of that cycle again but this time I have a lot of experience building and shipping products in production. 

Talent Protocol is about giving ownership of a user’s profile, career data, and social graph back to the individual. This directly aligns with my commitment to individual data ownership.

However, attending these conferences can be challenging, particularly given the costs associated with travel and accommodation.

It would enable me to connect with other developers and experts in the field, learn about the latest tools and techniques, and find inspiration for new projects and ideas.

In addition, I'm eager to contribute to the web3 community from a Turkish perspective. With Turkey's burgeoning tech scene and growing interest in blockchain and decentralized technologies, I believe my attendance at an Ethereum conference could help foster greater collaboration and understanding between the Turkish and international communities.

In parallel with the thesis, I started to take my first steps as a Blockchain Developer, learning mainly Solidity, React, JavaScript, Typescript and Rust.
I finished the course last December and right now I'm at DeHouse in Porto, creating my own Web3 project in the Desci (Decentralized Science) area and still working on other projects based on NFTs and DAOs. Every day is a learning experience for me, I learn everything by myself, in courses, tutorials, events in which I participate (All Braga.Blockchain in Portugal, Solana Breakpoint, WebSummit, all Denites and DeHouse events). I also signed up for EthLisbon but I wasn't chosen, probably because I don't have a team.

My job is to help fintechs in their growth process and design the regulatory framework for them to develop in the best way while being compliant with local regulations (I wrote the crypto regulation in Argentina). I`m part of the team who is responsible for the design and implementation of the CBDC of Argentina. Additionally, I am a university teacher at 2 universities. 
I learned about crypto several years ago when my manager told us that this was the future. When I read the Bitcoin white paper, I couldn't stop thinking that it was the future. My brain discovered something completely new and wonderful. 
It sounds like a joke, but it's not. Im pro crypto and I want to help it grow in my country.
No crypto bro would work at the Central Bank in my country, it's contradictory. Instead, I learned about crypto while working at the bank and consider myself one of the people who knows the most about national and international crypto regulations. I wrote several of them. It took me many years to understand it, but I believe that the widespread adoption of crypto will happen when the people who make the decisions understand that this is the future. Today, I am one of the people who has the power to make Argentina a pro-crypto country.

I am writing to express my interest in becoming one of the ten Talent House Scholars at your esteemed organization. I am excited about this opportunity because I believe my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for the program.

As a dedicated and driven individual, I have spent several years immersing myself in the world of blockchain technology and its potential applications. I have acquired a deep understanding of Ethereum, its core features, and the way it functions. I am also well-versed in the Solidity programming language and have contributed to several open-source projects. I have been working with React/TypeScrypt since a few years already (anthonycolas.com) and already raised 250k funding in Paris through an Esport startup (https://www.maddyness.com/2019/06/03/hook-acceleration-ecole-42-premiere-promotion/. in French sorry, but the name of the company is Myth)

Beyond my technical abilities, I am a team player who works well with others. I believe that collaboration is crucial in building successful projects and I am always willing to lend a hand and share my knowledge with others. In addition, I have a passion for learning and always seek out new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.

If chosen as one of the Talent House Scholars, I would be honored to work alongside and learn from some of the most talented individuals in the blockchain space. I am confident that my unique skill set and passion for the technology would allow me to make valuable contributions to the program. I also have been chosen by the Blockchain Founders Group to be in the next batch of Web3 entrepreneurs, which is a 3 months program to launch a startup.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

I'm very excited about the web3 space in general, with a constant hunger for learning more and finding out about neat things.

Whether it's programming, running an event, or making new connections, the one thing that satisfies me the most is seeing the hours of effort I put in pay off. Seeing the final product in motion and knowing that it's up to my standards is so rewarding and is what drives me to build more.

On top of this, I'm never afraid to ask for help and am always open to finding the best possible compromise if I don't understand something or if it isn't working out.

Most of my projects are created because there wasn't a solution for something yet and it really bugged me:

- Surge, a delta neutral stablecoin farm that takes advantage of the rate difference between borrowing an asset and staking it (ex. eth, matic).
I go over what inspired me to build it, how it works, and more here: https://tinyurl.com/56fh67w8

- Sector Finance Tracker, a simple app that shows the P/L of sector finance, a yield farming protocol that didn't have this feature implemented already.

Other side projects are created to practice new skills that I learned:

- Blockchain Elections, a proof-of-concept online voting system designed to promote transparency, security, and deter fraud. I created it to practice my solidity and python skills, then re-wrote the frontend a year later to practice my React skills.

No,Taylan,Ethereum Rio23,https://beta.talentprotocol.com/u/0xtaylan,"I have developed my interest in blockchain for the past two years at the Istanbul Technical University blockchain club to benefit the ecosystem as a whole. I’ve taken an active role in both technological and community aspects while studying electronics and communication engineering at university and chairing my university debate club. 

I have listened to the passionate stories of my fellow students who have had the opportunity to travel to countries they would not normally afford, such as Colombia and Mexico through scholarships. I was immediately inspired and began speaking to friends and family about what an amazing scholarship like this would mean for me. 
Gaining similar experiences would not only provide an opportunity for further life experience and knowledge with regards to blockchain, it would also help with my overall goal to spread the learning and experience gained from our community larger audiences. 

As a member of the ethereum community in Turkey, I would like to tell you what EthRio means to me: 
-> I want to connect with people I follow face to face, be inspired by their ideas, read their articles and ultimately expand my own vision. 
-> I would like a deep and thorough understanding of what exactly Ethereum promises. Specifically, the impact it is trying to create not only technologically but also sociologically. In this regard, I believe that connecting to fellow human beings in a natural environment, sharing the excitement in the air and discussing sociological and humanitarian aims openly will be critical to achieving this.
-> I am keen to work with people from different cultures who are passionate about developing a joint project. I believe the process of sharing knowledge is crucial and that synergistic work within our community will help to push me forward in this field.
-> I believe gaining life experiences and seeing new cultures will help me consider our role in different socioeconomic contexts. After Cuba, I would be keen to also see Brazil, another Latin American country. For me, understanding a culture involves dancing, making friends with local people and accumulating memories together

To conclude, I would be grateful for an opportunity to expand my knowledge of blockchain in a new and innovative environment with like-minded and creative individuals. It will be my first priority to transfer the knowledge I have gained here from different perspectives to the community and to inspire new people.  This would be an environment I wouldn’t have access to without your support. So if given the opportunity, I would do my absolute best to maximise my learning from it.

I would also like to support Talent House in developing this culture and understanding after the program.",ftaylanunal@gmail.com,'@unalf_Taylan,'@TaylanUnal,,,To meet new people and learn about web3 in general,Participate in the hackathon,,Student,,"Cryptİst,  Solana hacker house İstanbul, Crypto mondays",İstanbul,Yes,Yes,Male,,Middle Eastern,,,,Middle Eastern,,,,,Turkey,"I am 18 years old or older, Yes",,Friend Referral,,,,,Yes,ixubx12bg5stg0qlv3riixubmoe9a82s,,No,No,No,No,No,0xc13E958493324Cb10b969dE1d8b1ab432EF9a164

But I didn't like my department right away, and I wasn't able to discover exactly what I wanted to do. I met blockchain at a time when I was looking for what I wanted to do. Although many people met by trading, I learned him directly through technology. I changed my department and started to learn this technology with great dedication because I think that it has future potential and that I can be successful here. For the last three years, I've been spending all my time on blockchain. At the point I have reached now, besides learning, I am able to do undone things that can be beneficial for the community. There was a community that was very important to me during this process. He is Turkey's first university blockchain community, ITU Blockchain. We went on a nice journey with other people who want to learn blockchain technology in this community. In addition to explaining blockchain technology to more than 1000 people, with the support of the Ethereum Foundation, we prepared and shared the 34-hour smart contract development series for free with the support of the Ethereum Foundation, in order to solve the problem of people with foreign language problems in learning how to develop smart contracts. During this period when I spent my days for ITU Blockchain, I first learned from the people there and then I was able to give back what I learned to the community. This is really my favorite part of the Blockchain community. Learn from someone else, teach someone else. In addition, in this process, people from all over the world twitter etc. Being able to access easily through applications has really affected my development process very positively. I am currently among the developers of Fibrous Finance, the first and only AMM Aggregator on Starknet. I am also one of the founders of a company called Ethlene, which is focused on blockchain software, along with 6 people like me who have decided to build their lives on blockchain. We especially work on the development of projects that can physically touch daily life. I am currently trying to improve myself on core blockchain development processes beyond smart contract. Thanks to the people I met at the global events I went to, my development has accelerated. I am in constant communication with them about being able to joint projects. Global events show me that the community is not just Turkey and opens my horizons. Especially since Rio is a far away place from Turkey, it is very precious to me.

No,Revanth Gundala,Ethereum Rio23,https://beta.talentprotocol.com/u/revanthgundala,"I believe I would fit to be a Talent House Scholar at Ethereum Rio23 or ETHIstanbul for several reasons. First of all, I have a deep passion for blockchain technology. I have only started to get into the ecosystem over the past year, but in my time here I have taken a big initiative to be a part of the larger conversation. As I am currently a student studying computer science, when I found out about blockchain technology, I wanted to go all in on it because I knew that it would play a large part in bettering the lives of people in the future. A lot of the learning I have done has been entirely self taught, including the the many whitepapers, videos, and articles I have read about the subject. In my free time, I felt like I needed to learn how to develop smart contracts and dApps in order to truly engulf myself into the field. I have created numerous projects on Ethereum because I felt like the more I could develop, the more I could learn. I have also interacted with a numerous amount of protocols, primarily defi, in order to learn the ecosystem even further. I have never created something on such a large stage before, and I feel that if I continually learn and grow my knowledge about the field, I believe that I could make a meaningful contribution to the blockchain space. This is the primary reason I want to attend the conference. Meet likeminded people and create something amazing.

I believe that my unique perspective and skillset could contribute to the program in several ways. During the time of writing this, I am currently working for an educational blockchain organization that serves to teach others about blockchain through infographics. I believe that this has really enhanced my creative abilities since a huge problem with blockchain right now is not only the technology itself (scalability, applicability, etc.) but also lowering the barrier to entry for many newcomers (i.e. legislators, citizens, etc.). I feel this because I really enjoy talking to people from different backgrounds. I am currently president of the blockchain student organization at my university and I have also attended many blockchain meetups in my local area. Understanding everyone's viewpoints has made me develop a better intuition of why these people also love blockchain. It's all about evening the playing field and making people's lives better. It's that simple. Many of the people that are averse to learning about blockchain haven't found the appeal because they don't understand it's use cases, since people often associate blockchain with the prices of crypto. I hope that meeting with others from the same perspective as myself, we can figure out a solution to create something great for the ecosystem and make others believe in the benefits it could provide to society.

Finally, I am committed to making the most of this opportunity and am willing to put in the time and effort to learn as much as possible during my time as a Talent House Scholar.

Unluckily, I am a student and even though I am working simultaneously, I can not afford the complete expenses. I know many people who are going to attend this wonderful experience and I would be amazed if  I could meet them in person so that we can bond.

Up to now I only talked about what I want to receive, yet I am a strong believer that opportunities only work if there is a win-win situation. We do know certain things about incentives in web3 community, right? Through the last years I have been getting deeply involved into the startup ecosystem from the VCs point of view. It is a network really similar to web3, yet, it has some differences that make them very synergistic. I believe that coming from a world so much centered in the user and the feasibility of the projects and strongly getting into this one can benefit both of them. I would love to help other people with their projects, bringing a new point of view and challenging what they are currently thinking about them.

I am choosing Talent as many of my friends have chosen in the past who are presently ambassadors of this community. A community full of dreamers and high-potential builders. Just what I am aiming to find in ETHRio and ETHIstambul.

In conclusion, if I have to offer just one reason for attending to a Talent House, it is unquestionably faith. Faith over the people that will attend ETH Conferences, faith over the marvelous ideas that we will be talking about, and faith over the magnificent projects that we will buidl together.",bauticoro@gmail.com,Bauticoronado,Bautistacoronado,To find investors for my project,,To meet new people and learn about web3 in general,Participate in the hackathon,,Start-Up Founder,Toket.io,No,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Yes,Yes,Male,,Latino,,,Latino,,,,,,Argentina,"I am 18 years old or older, Yes",,Friend Referral,,,,,Yes,Bautista Coronado,ETHIstanbul,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,0x3C88F98D86d7850a5a7Dc48CAa894f288836fd22
No,Aadi Mukherjee,Ethereum Rio23,https://beta.talentprotocol.com/u/amukh,"Thank you for considering me for the 10 Talent House Scholar spots at Ethereum Rio23 or ETHIstanbul. I'm excited to apply for this opportunity and feel that I would be a great fit.

I'm incredibly passionate about blockchain technology, with a particular focus on Ethereum. I've been closely following its development for several years and have been actively involved in the blockchain community through my projects, research, and studies. I have a solid understanding of the technology, its potential applications, and the challenges that come with its implementation.

I also have extensive experience in software development and programming languages, including Solidity, the language used to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. My skills and experience would allow me to participate fully in the technical discussions and workshops at the conference.

Whoever gets into this phenomenon now has a chance to contribute in meaningful societal changes as it was with the early days of the industrial revolution, the internet, and also the IT revolution. Many people currently send and receive money through global banks, and when we do that, we put our implicit trust in intermediaries, including multiple layers of banking systems, government regulations, and various other facilitators. I believe there has been a growing loss of trust in these middlemen due to major economic events, such as the 2008 economic collapse. I have realized that this technology, with smart contracts powered by Ethereum tokens, will help create that ""trust nothing"" system (in which you won't have to trust a single individual or a body) that is more safe and secure.

Working on these blockchain projects aimed at societal issues, I'm eager to continue this work and potentially collaborate with others at the conference. I believe that Ethereum has the potential to revolutionize various industries and make a positive impact on people's lives, and I'm excited to explore this potential further at the event. 

Lastly, I value collaboration and networking, and I'm excited to meet and learn from other talented individuals and experts in the field. In addition to this being a great opportunity for me to talk to attendees about my recently completed ""Decentralized eBay"" project, I am also actively looking for a potential partner for my current work on an Ethereum security apparatus. I believe that attending Ethereum Rio23 or ETHIstanbul as a Talent House Scholar would provide me with a unique opportunity to further develop my skills, knowledge, and network, and make valuable contributions to the industry.

To conclude, I'm a passionate and skilled individual with a strong commitment to the development and implementation of blockchain technology. I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of attending the conference as a Talent House Scholar and believe that I could bring valuable insights and ideas to either event. Thank you again for considering my application.",aadimukherjee6@gmail.com,https://twitter.com/aadi_mukherjee,aadimukherjee,To find investors for my project,To get a job in web3,To meet new people and learn about web3 in general,Participate in the hackathon,,Web3/Smart Contracts Developer,https://github.com/IlliniBlockchain/agora-marketplace,"Although I haven't attended any conferences yet, I have had the opportunity to organize and facilitate a ""Blockchain Summit"" with my organization, Illini Blockchain. The event included a series of workshops that aimed to introduce attendees to the basics of Solidity code, NFTs, and creating MetaMask wallets. We were thrilled to have Vitalik Buterin as our keynote speaker, which was a huge honor for our team.  As a facilitator for the Blockchain Summit, I gained valuable experience in organizing and executing educational events. I learned how to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages attendees to learn and collaborate with each other. The experience was also an opportunity to network with other blockchain enthusiasts and experts in the field.  I'm excited about the prospect of attending a future Ethereum conference and building on my experience at the Blockchain Summit. I'm eager to learn from and collaborate with other blockchain developers, and to contribute my skills and knowledge to the community. I'm confident that attending the conference would provide me with unique insights and ideas to further my understanding of the technology and its applications.","If I am accepted into Ethereum Rio 2023, I will for sure be flying into Rio from Chicago, Illinois.

After that, I became a board member of this club as external relations coordinator and was part of several trainings and workshops within the club. I also started to learn Solidity during the pandemic and joined our devs team.

With the club, I gave many workshop and education for new commers. Also with developer tem I joined 5 hackathons, and we won two of them. In general, I was active in the idea phase in hackathons, and afterward, I had multiple help and responsibilities such as coordinating the operation of the team, researching the issues we were working on, preparing the pitch deck, and making presentations. Two of these hackathons was İstanbul Avalanche Hackathon and Avalanche Barcelona Summit. Then I went ETH Prague and Berlin Blockchain Week (ETH Berlin). And lastly  I went a Tel Aviv for Starkware Sessions with a grant.

Since I started working in the blockchain field, I have attended all ecosystem meetups and hackathons where I could find scholarships.

No,,Ethereum Rio23,https://beta.talentprotocol.com/u/juancamp1987,"I have been in crypto for more than 5 years, but since last year I decided to dedicate myself full time to this space and I love being a part of all the events as much as I can because I want to learn and connect with people from different cultures and ways of thinking.
Sometimes I can't afford to be there for lack of money. Fortunately I have been able to attend DevconVI, ETHSanFrancisco, Próspera DeFi Summit and ETHDenver, and all this I have been able to achieve because I have worked hard to get the money and I have volunteered in most of them, but I think that for those who come as RIO or Istanbul will be very difficult for me to pay so I need help because I would love to go.
I am also founding a project on forest and ecosystem conservation using NFT technologies and I think it is very important to be at those events connecting and launching my startup.
I have been growing in the Web3 space and have opened my own way as a Discord expert, Translator, CGP Editor, Speaker, etc. and i want to grow more and learn more.
So... please accept my Scholarship this time.",juancamp1987@hotmail.com,'@juanjgiraldoc,juanjgiraldoc,To find investors for my project,To get a job in web3,To meet new people and learn about web3 in general,Participate in the hackathon,Connect with people,Community Manager,"https://dgguardians.com/
